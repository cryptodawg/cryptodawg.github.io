# This is a test post!

I've been wanting to make a blog to document all of my tinkering about, and hopefully help a few people out who stumble into the same issues I come across! I wanted something that I can quickly get up and running, as I don't want to fuss with hosting and software installation (for now, at least). A coworker of mine mentioned [Hexo](https://hexo.io), a simple to use static site generator. I thought this was an awesome idea, but I also noticed that GitHub Pages has Jekyll installed by default, which accomplishes much of the same tasks with much less fussing about with installation. I may use Hexo at some point once I've fully dived into getting my blog up and running, but I figure this is a good place to start!

I'm noticing that the [documentation](https://pages.github.com) doesn't tell you much about how to create blog individual blog posts, but I figure this shouldn't be too difficult. I'm willing to bet it's as simple as committing individual files that Jekyll then combines all into a single page.

Here goes nothing! Committing to master and pushing to remote...

## Yeah, I was wrong...

I tried a simple commit, but this post still isn't appearing. This is my current folder structure:
```console
$ ls
_config.yml  index.md  test.md
```

I'm seeing a lot online about creating a `_posts` folder in the repository root directory and putting the post there. I should also rename this file so it's prepended by the current date, which will make it much easier to find later. Let's try that!
```console
$ mkdir _posts

$ ls
_config.yml  _posts/  index.md  test.md

$ mv test.md _posts/2018-07-22-test.md

$ ls _posts
2018-07-22-test.md
```

Commit number two, let's go!

## Still wrong...

Let's set about installing Jekyll locally - that way I don't need to constantly push to Github to see if it worked.

## All installed!

Alright, I've installed Jekyll locally. However, it's initialized a full local copy of my website _within_ the current repository that will then be published to the remote. I need to move the local copy to outside the repo and use that as the folder I'll push from. I know I'll run into Git issues - but that's good, as I'm also not all that familiar with Git!

## AHA! Got it!

I actually didn't need to move the local copy to outside the repo and use that as where I'd be pushing from, all I had to do was simply merge what was in the subdirectory with what was in the main directory. This post now shows up! WOOT!
